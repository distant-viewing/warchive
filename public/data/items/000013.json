It was easier for 29-year-old Artem Bakanov to leave Donetsk in 2014 than Kyiv - now. Back then, he didn't have much. It was difficult to find a place to stay in Odesa, where he moved with his girlfriend - people from Donbas often faced prejudice. The couple worked as waiters and tempered their spirits. They participated in pro-Ukrainian rallies together with their peers.\n\nThen, they moved to Kyiv, had a lot of work, and made their first attempts to open a business. Finally, they could feel the sky was the limit. Artem has managed to join the restaurant business, develop his own company and taxi services as well as start the project on shipping vehicles from the US. The possibility of the attack on Kyiv sounded ridiculous. \"\"On 23d, in the evening, I tried to calm down my wife. I was telling her that everything was going to be okay. Everyone kept withdrawing cash from their accounts, and I kept reloading mine with foreign currency, in turn. It took one morning to lose everything you've been working on for the last eight years. It took one morning to lose the feeling of safety.\"\"\n\nAfter the next move - to Lviv this time - they asked themselves what was next. Artem's partner offered to start a school of self-defense. Every day, volunteers from Kharkiv, Odesa, Kyiv, and Lviv teach 120-150 people. Medical and military instructors offer their knowledge and help. Now, they are building a shooting range so that any visitor can learn how to shoot air gun correctly and safely.","graphic":0,"tag_id":32,"month":"2022-03-01","id":"000013","ttag":"De-occupied territories"}
