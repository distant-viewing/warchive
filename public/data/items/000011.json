She saw that I wore clothes of the same size as her. The next day she brought me two trunks of clothes. She said that if I didn't need those, I could give them to others. I was so grateful. For the first time, I was fully ready for the season. \"\n \n This time Lyubov fled the war from Dnipro. Eight years ago, she fled Debaltseve. Her brightest memories of May 2014 are the following. First, when she was contemplating going to a referendum. Her son was talking her out of it. He said: \"Mom, you were born in Ukraine. Who else needs us? See how people live in the Ural region. They need someone to save themselves. Russia will not give you anything.\" Lyubov agreed with her son.\nThe second memory was when she was waiting for the shelling in the basement of her home. \"Our yard has always been green and bushy. There were so many tall trees. And when they came out of the basement after the shelling, it was so light that my eyes hurt. They fired so hard that not a single leaf on a tree was left. \"\n \n Now Luybov does not know where her house is located geographically. She only knows that home is where her son, daughter-in-law, and four-year-old granddaughter are.","graphic":0,"tag_id":24,"month":"2022-03-01","id":"000011","ttag":"Life under occupation"}
