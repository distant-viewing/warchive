Courageously craving to turn Mariupol into the cultural capital of Donbas, she has created an art platform called ‘ТЮ’ (‘TIU’). Now, she helps the residents of Mariupol to escape the occupied city. \n \n‘Just like other migrants, we have put a lot of love into rebuilding our life in a new place. Our entire lives were left back at home, including art and close ones who did not have phone service. We were grateful for the Donetsk that we used to have. That’s why we put all our love into the new home in Mariupol. We had to furnish it from scratch, so we got cats, and we bought string lights to put in the apartment overlooking the theater. Now, my loss of home hurts even deeper. Back then, we were still able to go to Donetsk on occasion, but as for Mariupol, there’s nowhere to return to. However, we are not ready to accept it yet. We already know that the overwhelming pain and apathy are normal and finite, so we don’t rush to start building a new life. We need to wait a bit. We will be of the most use to Ukraine if we continue to live and do our thing. We are not yet considering opening a new venue in Lviv. For us, it would mean putting an end to everything we’ve built in Mariupol.’ \"","graphic":0,"tag_id":24,"month":"2022-03-01","id":"000008","ttag":"Long-distance attacks"}
