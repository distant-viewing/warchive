'My daughter Natasha was 1,5 years old when we had to flee from the shellings in Luhansk. We went to our relatives in Severodonetsk to wait till it was all over. Eight years later, the full-fledged war has found them there. They spent the first nine days in a bomb shelter. A nine-year-old daughter tried to cheer her mother up as much as she could. As we heard explosions,  she kept saying, 'Don't be scared.' \n \nDuring these years in her new home Anastasiia has achieved a lot. She worked at a local university, attained a second higher education, got a job as an editor at a radio station, and bought an apartment where she lived with her daughter and mother. But all these years, the feeling of anxious anticipation has never left. 'In 2018, my father died; he couldn't take all this. He was such a patriot. He was even buried with a flag. He has always told me to be alert. 'russian world,' he said, will expand sooner or later. And I was always afraid of that.' \n \nNow, Anastasiia is in Drohobych, Western Ukraine, thinking about what to do next. She sees her new home where she is able to find a job.","graphic":0,"location":"Drohobytskyi"}
