In 2014, Andriy Shchekun, a public activist from Crimea, organized a resistance movement on the peninsula, urging people to stand against the tricolor with Ukrainian flags. After 11 days of being captured by the so-called ‘Crimean self-defense,’ Andriy, along with other activists, was exchanged for a russian high-ranking official. Since then, the man has been living in Kyiv and calling himself a forcibly deported Crimean citizen. In February 2022, he had to leave his home again. Now he is working in a logistics center that transfers humanitarian aid from abroad to hotspots. \n \n‘I generally find it quite easy to adapt to any circumstances. I have lived most of my life in group homes due to my health. My wife is having a much harder time. She often wakes up at three in the morning and cries. She is from Bakhchisarai. Her parents died there, and she hasn’t been able to attend the funeral. It’s incredibly painful. Her home is where her parents’ graves are.’","graphic":0,"tag_id":17,"month":"2022-04-01","id":"000004","ttag":"De-occupied territories"}
