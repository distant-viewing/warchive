Moving from Kyiv to a village in the Ivano-Frankivsk region didn't stop two sisters - Ksenia and Tetiana Ivanov - from working. The girls are working for a civil organization, \"Elias.\" Now their work revolves around those who were affected by war. Shelters for victims of domestic violence are being repurposed for the needs of internally displaced people.\n\nThe sisters are from Donetsk. In 2014 they didn't even consider \"waiting the fighting out.\" Their pro-Ukrainian parents quickly realized that they didn't want to live there anymore and moved to Kyiv. But this time, they didn't flee on principle. They stayed at home, in their Kyiv. \"Perhaps it makes it easier for me when it's easier for them. They don't leave their home. It's almost as if they are paying their debt to this new city that became their home.\" - Tetiana says.\n\nIt's as painful for her to experience war now as it was the first time around, eight years earlier. \"You can't ever be ready for such a tragedy even if you've experienced it before. You have dreams, make plans, build your life from scratch - and all this makes it even worse. russians are once again taking these most precious things from us.\"","graphic":0,"location":"Ivano-Frankivsk"}
