Marina Shulzhenko, with her parents and daughter Masha, moved from the town of Khartsyzsk in the Donetsk region to Bila Tserkva near Kyiv in 2014. In 2022 they were once again forced to move. This time to the village of Bogorodchany in western Ukraine.\n\nMarina says that both times it was hard to leave her house. \"It feels like the war is following us. There's nowhere to hide from it. Nowhere is safe. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. It would reach us even across the border.\n\nFear and grief. That's probably what all of us refugees feel.\n\nWe became very attached to Bila Tserkva throughout these eight years. I want to return there as soon as possible once it's safe to go there.\"","graphic":0,"tag_id":24,"month":"2022-03-01","id":"000007","ttag":"De-occupied territories"}
