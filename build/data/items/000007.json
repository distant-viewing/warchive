Public official Artur Stadnik is 26 now. When there were ongoing battles for Donetsk, he was going through the Work and Travel program in the USA. He hasn't come back to his parents' home.

He was quite young to be able to build a new life without serious difficulties.\n\n\"Sure, I could always sense the sadness in the background, but I was holding up well. Yes, the house was taken away from my family, but it couldn't repeat, not again. And then, the Russians expanded their military presence, and I wasn't so sure anymore. I arranged my documents, had a medical screening at a draft board, and, since December, have been packing and unpacking my things. I'm staying at my aunt's place - she has fled to Germany.\"\n\nWhen asked where his home is, Artur answers: 'Ukraine.'","graphic":0,"location":"Lviv"}
