It was called Krasnyi Luch then. They were hiding in their basement up to the moment they became the only ones who hadn't left the neighborhood. Liudmyla recalls that the scariest thing she experienced when leaving the occupied Donbas region was their way across the bridge. The latter suffered from an explosion, so it was patched up with boards. Luckily, they managed to reach Kyiv safely.\n\n\"\"On 24th, early in the morning, I was going to work and already could hear explosions. I told my friend from Debaltsevo: 'Liuba, I guess the war is here.' A lot of people didn't want to flee. And I kept insisting and telling them that they couldn't imagine how hard it will be if the events escalate.\"\"\n\nNow, it's even harder, the couple admits; it's the age probably. When the shelling of Kyiv stopped being so frequent, they had doubts whether they did the right thing when leaving the capital. Now, they consider coming back as soon as possible - coming back to their true home.\"","graphic":0,"tag_id":8,"month":"2022-03-01","id":"000012","ttag":"Life under occupation"}
