I know that life doesn't end there. It will go on. War is a test that shows what you're capable of and how much faith and willingness to fight you have in you.\" - says the journalist of \"Donbas. Realii\" project from Radio Svoboda Daria Kurinna.\n\nShe hadn't left her occupied city of Donetsk until it got too dangerous. She remembers that she was in another city in the Donetsk region when it happened. She came back for her belongings when the city saw fighting. She was lucky to get through the checkpoint. The bus that followed them was shot at and destroyed. She's now joking that she has improved packing skills: she can pack the entire house in 30 minutes. And she left Kyiv not with a backpack but with a suitcase.\n\n\"On the 24th, when the shelling began, I fell off my bed, covered my head with my hands, and thought: \"Fuck, again?\". I immediately realized that I was going to leave Kyiv. I didn't want to put myself in harm's way again - I had another frontline to attend to. I also realized that I will definitely return to my Donetsk soon enough.\"","graphic":0,"location":"Truskavets"}
