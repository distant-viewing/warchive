Mariia Pronina relocated from Donetsk to Mariupol relatively recently, four years ago. With time, she has joined the art platform ‘TIU.’ She says that moving the second time was harder than the first. \n \n‘In 2014 in Donetsk, my life wasn’t really interesting or special. I was 27. I was simply escaping the danger. I was living in dorms or renting apartments with my friends but in safe Ukrainian territories. Now, no place is safe. \n \nI’ve come a long way after 2014.I certainly know what I want now. We had a goal to build up the cultural life in Mariupol. The city was developing, and we saw it as our contribution. All that was destroyed. The city that I chose and that I wanted to live in got completely destroyed. \n \nIt really hurts.’ \"","graphic":0,"location":"Lviv"}
